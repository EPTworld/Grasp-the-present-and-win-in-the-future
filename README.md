Grasp the present and win in the future! 
1. The new ecology has been launched. Before some incentive levels are generated, the network-wide transaction fee will be distributed equally to the alliance partners (algorithm: transaction fee/number of partners who have activated the converter = current income), so that the alliance partners can be obtained in advance benefit. 
2. When the new ecosystem is launched, the system only reserves 2% of the transaction fee as maintenance fee, and the rest is used as an incentive mechanism.
3. Learn from the advantages and develop long-term. The new ecology is launched to optimize the entry of new users, and the corresponding number of converters will be given away. This benefit will be issued by the alliance partners who have activated the converters. Hereby notice, please pay attention to the next announcement for details!

2、新生态上线，系统仅预留交易手续费2%作为维护费，其余用于激励机制。
3、借鉴优势，长远发展。新生态上线优化新用户进场，赠送相应数量转换器，此项权益由已启动转换器的联盟合伙人发放。
